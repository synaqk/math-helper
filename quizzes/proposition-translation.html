          "If the sequence is not short, then it is increasing and long."
        ],
        explanation: "The `→` operator translates to 'if...then...'. The antecedent (the 'if' part) is the conjunction `(i ∧ l)`, meaning 'increasing AND long'. The consequent (the 'then' part) is `¬s`, meaning 'not short'."
